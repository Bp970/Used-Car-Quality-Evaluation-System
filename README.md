# Used-Car-Quality-Evaluation-System


1:-INTRODUCTION 
  *  Many people get scammed while    buying a used car over the quality of the car they are buying.
  * The quality evaluation system helps one in confirming whether the car they are buying is worth it or not.

# 2:-Evolution: 
* This project is helpful in preventing them from getting scammed by dealers. So, we will build a system using Python, sklearn which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy.
 #Proposed System: 
This system will detect the car, run it through its system and give us an analysis on whether the car is acceptable or not. This system will be very useful to prevent scams by alerting the buyer on whether it’s a good deal or not and categorizing the quality as unacceptable, acceptable, good, or very good.

# 3:- Project Description
* In this Python project, we will be using Sklearn for gathering the images from the input and feeding them into a Deep Learning model which will classify whether the car’s quality is ‘Unacceptable’, ‘Acceptable’, ‘Good’, ‘Very good. The approach we will be using for this Python project is as follows
Step 1 – Take image as input from the user. 
Step 2 – Detect the car in the image and analyze the car. 
Step 3 – Detect the quality of the car. 
Step 4 – Evaluate the quality of the car. 
Step 5 – Give the graphical representation of the analysis.
